# surfaceGo-wifi

A simple bash script that will autofix wifi not working after a fresh install of Linux on a Surface Go tablet, works whenever the OS updates as well.

Download the board.bin file: http://www.killernetworking.com/support/K1535_Debian/board.bin

If you are connected via Ethernet then the script can download the board.bin file as well.

Currently tested and works on:

-Ubuntu 20.04

-Kali 2020.3

-ParrotOS 4.11
